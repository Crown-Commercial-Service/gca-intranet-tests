  "content": "<p><strong>Clare Gibbs, Director of Markets, Sourcing and Suppliers (MSS) introduces her team, sharing her perspective on the creation of the Government Commercial Agency (GCA) alongside Colin Morrow, Principal Commercial Director.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Clare</h2>\n<p>First of all I would like to thank everyone for the incredibly warm welcome I’ve received. Having spent 28 years in the Civil Service, I’ve experienced many changes, but the alignment between CCS and the Markets, Sourcing and Suppliers (MSS) Team that I lead, feels like such an exciting opportunity to take advantage of; combining our complementary strengths within one organisation.</p>\n<p>Delivering excellent public services is a critical function of government – and the MSS team continues to support colleagues across central government departments, the wider public sector and the supplier base to improve the way we assess, manage and deliver outsourced services. We work across the whole commercial lifecycle – from the start, ensuring we have the right policies in place, to understanding the wider commercial environment, to partnering with our strategic suppliers. We provide best practice guidance and support to ensure government sourcing decisions maximise value for money and minimise risks to the delivery of public services.</p>\n<p>The opportunities presented by the creation of the GCA are even greater – by sharing our goals, knowledge and expertise we can combine our strengths and have an even greater impact. This will not only benefit our work with the market and value for taxpayers, but will ultimately improve and secure the delivery of vital public services.</p>\n<h2>Colin</h2>\n<p>From my perspective, the formation of the GCA is quite simple: it is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Merging the strategic expertise of the Cabinet Office with the operational excellence of CCS is the natural next step for common services to support the public sector and government. But it’s essential to remember the only reason we are in this position is because of the incredible success we’ve achieved on both CCS and GCF. If we collectively hadn’t proven our value, this wouldn’t be the direction of travel.</p>\n<p>Bringing together CCS and our colleagues from across the GCF aligns skills and capabilities across government. My focus is on the leadership we can provide to our customers to produce a bigger impact, where we have a responsibility to guide them towards outcomes that are simpler, faster, and better. I want us all to be able to say we realise value for the nation with genuine pride.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just a slogan; it’s about our collective motivation to live our values – to listen, trust, respect, and collaborate – and to share the stories of our success.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>Our joint request to you is twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To maintain momentum: Our business-as-usual delivery is what earned us the right to form the GCA. Please don’t take your foot off the gas!</li>\n<li>Keep us honest: The future is what we make it. If you feel we are getting it wrong, reach out to Exco or your line manager. We need your feedback to ensure GCA works for everyone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are incredibly proud to be leading this transition to GCA with you. Let’s continue to deliver excellence and value for the nation as we move toward 1 April.</p>",
